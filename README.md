<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The name of the app is nekosama. this app allows you to show off your cat to the fullest.

For example:
You start a thread titled "Angry 😤". After you set a deadline for the thread, you publish it and start bragging 🔥🔥🔥 Each user posts a photo of his/her cat according to the theme of the thread. Each photo can be marked as a favorite ✨ and the photo of the user's cat with the most favorites within a specified time limit will be displayed on the top screen of the app 😳 We are planning to add many other features such as a ranking function that changes depending on the number of favorites received and the number of posts ✌️.

Why don't you show off your nekosama to the fullest?
("nekosama" is the Japanese word for "god" that reigns over the owner, the servant 😂)

The four main functions are
- ☕️  Create threads
- 🤳 Post pictures of your cat
- 📝 Comment (where everyone comments on the good things about their cats)
- 👑 Ranking (Compete to see how cute your cat is. The top rankers may get a present.)

Scheduled release:
Scheduled for October 2022
